My [template](https://ia.net/writer/templates) for [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer):

![iA Writer template](/screenshot.png?raw=true)

So, it's just:

- Verdana as the main font
    - bigger font size
- 100% limit for images width
    - no margins for figures
- a bit nicer margins for headers
- a bit better styles for code blocks
- other smaller improvements
